# **Simon-Says**
## The Brand New "Theoretical" Esoteric Programming Language

###### Simon Says is a _theoretical_ imperative esoteric programming language that is compiled to C and then to machine code.
###### Programs written in Simon Says have the file ending .ss
###### It can be compiled in many different ways but the best option is using the Anhar compiler which causes the code to run in **twice** the amount of time and forces your CPU to heat up because there's no way that the room is warm enough.
###### Every line of code must start with the command "Simon Says: " otherwise it will be considered a comment.
### Features:
- **Easy to Learn**
- **Includes: Sequence, Selection and Iteration**
- **Very Human Readable**
-  **Great for Beginners**
